# Camera Privacy Specification V5

## V5.0

### About

This is version 5 of the Camera Privacy Specification. The first 2 versions don't have a tagged release yet. This specification goes over a hardware component known as a lid that should be applied to all camera-enabled devices, so users can control their privacy better without having to put tape over their cameras.

Please remember that you must always follow the latest official specification of this project. Following older versions or alternative specifications breaks the agreement and violates user privacy and therefore user trust.
