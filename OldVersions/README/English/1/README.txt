Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_Wikipedia/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Note: currently, translations in languages other than English only apply to version 2. You must speak English to use this specification until a verified translation for the latest version is available.

## Specification

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the specification.</b></p></summary>

### Overview

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the overview section.</b></p></summary>

**Applies to:** every digital device that uses a camera of any image/video/audio quality. The main focus goes to a lid that covers the camera entirely.

## Lid

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the lid section.</b></p></summary>

### Definition

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the lid definition section.</b></p></summary>

<!--

| ‚ÑπÔ∏è Example of a lid sliding over a webcam |

A lid is a cover that slides over the camera, preventing it from recording anything but the lid. When the lid is active, the webcam cannot record anything.

A rollover lid must be applicable to every camera. The lid must be 100% opaque, with absolutely no transparency/translucency, and it must be durable enough to last 50 or more years (as part of [:octocat: `Hardware Longevity`](https://github.com/Seanpm2001/Hardware-Longevity/)) 

</details> <!-- End of lid definition section !-->

---

### Wireless connectivity

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the wireless connectivity section.</b></p></summary>

The lid cannot be connected with any wireless connection, including but not limited to:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>

- Wi-Fi
- BlueTooth
- LAN
- WLAN
- Cellular data (1x, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, 6G data, etc)

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<!-- Removed: too vague
- Cloud
!-->

This means that the lid cannot be controlled by any wireless mean, the lid must be openable using a hand, or a software function included in the operating system.

</details> <!-- End of wireless connectivity section !-->

---

### Detachability and software support

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the detachability and software support section.</b></p></summary>

The lid must be detachable with open source software, and there has to be a choice for the user to choose a different lid opening software/application if needed. Creators of lid opening software must follow this specification as well. The software for the lid cannot rely on system time or UNIX time, and must be 64 bit. The lid cannot be locked to expire at a certain date.

</details> <!-- End of detachability and software support section !-->

---

### Opening and closing

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the opening and closing section.</b></p></summary>

The lid must take no more than 10 seconds to open and close electronically or manually (For manual opening, the user can take however long they want, but it must be doable within 10 seconds, even by an infant). The lid must be able to be closed or opened both with software, and with manual force (even with the hand of an infant) the lid must be secure.

</details> <!-- End of opening and closing section !-->

---

### Additional cameras, Internet connnections, and virtual assistants

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Additional cameras, Internet connnections, and virtual assistants section.</b></p></summary>

The lid cannot contain additional cameras (a webcam on a webcam) or other tracking devices. The lid cannot integrate with "smart" software assistants/virtual assistants, including but not limited to:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>

- Google Assistant
- Samsung Bixby
- Amazon Alexa
- Apple Siri

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

</details> <!-- End of Additional cameras, Internet connnections, and virtual assistants section !-->

---

### Covering the webcam light

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the covering the webcam light section.</b></p></summary>

The lid cannot cover the light that indicates that the Webcam is turned on, either while the lid is open or closed.

</details> <!-- End of covering the webcam light section !-->

---

### Inclusion with the device

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the inclusion with the device section.</b></p></summary>

The lid must be included with the device, it cannot be a separate component, or an attachment. The lid must be repairable and replaceable at any time, with or without a device warranty. Destruction of the lid should not destroy the rest of the device.

</details> <!-- End of Inclusion with the device section !-->

---

### Following the specification

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the following the specification section.</b></p></summary>

The lid specification must be followed in its entirety, without cherrypicking. You must always follow the latest version of the lid specification from the original author, even if it is not available in your native language.

Note: currently, translations in languages other than English only apply to version 2. You must speak English to use this specification until a verified translation for the latest version is available.

</details> <!-- End of Following the specification section !-->

---

### Additional cameras

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the additional cameras section.</b></p></summary>

The lid itself cannot contain cameras on it or around it. Any other cameras must also come with a lid with all the same rules listed in this specification.

</details> <!-- End of Additional cameras section !-->

### Specification application

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the specification application section.</b></p></summary>

The specification applies to all users, including but not limited to the user, the government, corporations, foundations, organizations, communities, etc.

</details> <!-- End of Specification application section !-->

---

### Lid labels

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the lid labels section.</b></p></summary>

The lid cannot contain any labels that persuade the user not to use the lid. You are allowed to put your company logo on the lid, but it can't damage its lifespan or suggest that the lid is faulty.

</details> <!-- End of Lid labels section !-->

---
