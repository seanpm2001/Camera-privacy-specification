Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_Wikipedia/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page.

Creators of lid opening software must follow this specification as well. The software for the lid cannot rely on [`system time`](#System-time) or [`UNIX time`](#UNIX-Time), and must be [`64 bit`](#64-bit) or higher. The lid cannot be locked to [`expire at a certain date`](#Expiration).

</details> <!-- End of detachability and software support section !-->

---

### Opening and closing

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the opening and closing section.</b></p></summary>

The lid must take no more than 10 seconds to open and close electronically or [`manually`](#Manually) (For manual opening, the user can take however long they want, but it must be doable within 10 seconds, even by an infant).

## Definitions

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

### Webcam

A webcam is a camera that is capable of streaming to the Internet. It is normally part of a computer in the top middle, or is separate, and is attached to the screen.

### Rollover Lid

A rollover lid is a lid that can roll open and roll closed.

### Opaque

Opaque is the opposite of transparent. If something is 100% opaque, you cannot see through it. If something is 10% opaque, you can see through it.

### Transparency

Transparency is the opposite of opaque. If something is 100% transparent, you can see through it. If something is 0% transparent, you cannot see through it.

### Translucency


### Open source software

Open Source software is software that has its source code publicly available. You can see, modify, and redistribute the source code (often under license terms) not to be confused with shared source software, which is software where you have to get special permission to see the source code, and you can't redistribute it.

### Choice

In this context, choice means option. If the user wants to use the lid, they can choose to open it. If the user does not want to open the lid, they can choose to keep it closed. Nobody else can take away this choice.

### Lid opening software

Lid opening software is software that is programmed to open the lid of the camera.

### System time

System time is the time a computer uses. In this context, it means that the time on the computers clock can't determine when or why the lid will open.

### UNIX Time

UNIX time is a form of system time for UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux, Android, MacOS, iOS, BSD, and more. Time is represented with a number, which increases with every second that passes since the time 1970, January 1st at 12:00:00 am.

### 64 bit

64 bit computing is computing with a processor that can handle 64 bits (2^64=9,223,372,036,854,775,807) this has implications on system time, especially UNIX time. On 32 bit systems (2^32=4,294,967,296) UNIX time stops in the year 2038, but with 64 bit time, it can go for millions of years.

### Expiration

In this context, expiration means software that stops working after a certain point/date.

### Manually

Manually doing something is doing something without the aid of a computeer.

### Indicator light

The indicator light on a webcam is a light that comes on to tell you that the webcam is recording.

### Separate component

The lid cannot be a separate component, meaning the lid must be included with the computer.

### Attachment

The lid cannot be an add-on attachment to the device, it should be included with the computer.

### Right to repair

The right to repair is the right to modify and fix a device owned by the user that is damaged or broken. It is an important right. Without it, computers are thrown away and wasted, instead of being repaired. This costs resources and money.

### Device warranty

A device warranty is a warranty that covers the support of a computing device for a certain amount of time after purchase, where tech support and repairs are cheaper.

### Destroy the rest of the device

If moving the lid damages or destroys the rest of the device, it is a violation of the specification.

### Cherrypicking

[`Wikipedia:Cherry picking v1246738244`](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cherry_picking&oldid=1246738244&useskin=monobook)

> Cherry picking, suppressing evidence, or the fallacy of incomplete evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion of related and similar cases or data that may contradict that position. Cherry picking may be committed intentionally or unintentionally.

### Software license

A software license is a license that tells you what you can and cannot do with a piece of software.

### Labels

Labels that discourage the usage of the lid are discouraged.

### Branding

Branding is allowed on the lid. You can put your company logo on the lid, so long as it doesn't interfere with its functionality.

### Source code

Source code is the data that makes up computer software.

### Tracking devices

A tracking device is a software/hardware component that listens, and collects user information with or without the users permission.

### Smart software assistants

A "smart" software assistant, or virtual assistant, is a voice guided software tool that listens to voice commands, and gives responses to them.
